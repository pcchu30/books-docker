We “Dockerize” our Django project via Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.
Docker is lightweight and faster. Linux containers rely on the same Linux operating. With Docker we
simply share two files–a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` file–and we can have
confidence that our local development environment is exactly the same as the rest of the team.
